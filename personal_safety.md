# **PERSONAL SAFETY**
Cmty Help, LLC believes the vast majority of its users are trustworthy and well meaning. However, we strongly advise you adhere to common sense safety tips both online and offline.
 
# **Online Behavior**

## Protect Your Finances

Never respond to any request to send money via wire transfer (especially overseas), and report it to us immediately – even if the person claims to be in an emergency. Wiring money is like sending cash: the sender has no protections against loss and it’s nearly impossible to reverse the transaction or trace the money. 

## Protect Your Personal Information

Never give certain personal information, such as: your social security number, credit card number or bank information, or your work or home address to people you don’t know or haven’t met in person.

## Report All Suspicious Behavior 

Additionally, please report anyone who violates our Terms of Use

Examples of terms of use violations include:

•	Minors using the Site without the permission of parents or legal guardians.

•	Users sending harassing or offensive messages

•	Users behaving inappropriately after meeting in person

•	Fraudulent registration or profiles.

•	Spam or excessive solicitation.

•	Any prohibited activities in our Terms of Use. 


# **Offline Behavior**

Meeting in person can be exciting, but always take precautions and follow these guidelines to help you stay safe.

## Get to Know the Other Person on the Site

Keep your communications on the Site and really get to know users online prior to meeting them in person. Ask others about users in your community. Bad actors often push people to communicate off the Site immediately. It’s up to you to research and do your due diligence. 

## Always Meet and Stay in Public

We advise you meet in a public place first – never in a private or remote location and never inside a home or apartment if you never met that person before. 

## Tell Your Friends and Family Members of Your Plans

Inform a friend or family member of your plans and when and where you’re going or if anyone is coming to you. Make sure you have your cell phone charged and with you at all times. 

## Transport Yourself to and from the Meeting

You need to be independent and in control of your own transportation, especially in case things don’t work out. 

## Stay Sober

Consumption of alcohol and/or other drugs can impair your judgment and potentially put you in danger. It’s important to keep a clear mind and avoid anything that might place you at risk. Be aware that bad actors might try to take advantage of you by altering your beverage(s) with synthetic substances.
